                            Biking, also known as cycling, is the act of riding a bicycle. It involves pedaling to propel the bike forward, typically on roads, paths, 
                            trails, or other designated routes. Biking can be recreational, competitive,or a means of transportation.
                    <br><br>
                    It requires basic equipment like a bicycle and helmet, with optional accessories for comfort and safety. Biking not only 
                    provides a mode of exercise but also a way to enjoy the outdoors, reduce stress, and connect with communities through shared
                     paths and cycling events.

                            Paragliding is a recreational and competitive adventure sport where participants glide through the air using a 
                            lightweight, free-flying wing. Pilots launch themselves from elevated points such as hills or mountains, typically 
                            using wind currents and thermals to stay aloft. The sport offers a thrilling experience of soaring silently above 
                            landscapes, with pilots maneuvering by shifting body weight and controlling lines attached to the wing.

                            Surfing is a water sport where participants ride waves using a surfboard. Surfers paddle out into the ocean, wait for 
                            suitable waves, then catch and ride them towards the shore. It requires balance, agility, and wave-reading skills to 
                            maneuver the board on the moving water surface. Surfing can be done on various types of surfboards, including 
                            longboards for stability or shortboards for agility. 
                    <br><br>
                    It's enjoyed as both a recreational activity and a competitive
                    sport, with surfers often seeking out beaches with consistent waves and favorable conditions for optimal surfing 
                    experiences.
